Coffee Machine (Object-Oriented) â˜•

This project is a playful Python simulation of a coffee machine, built with object-oriented principles. It started as a fun way to practice Python without getting bored and ended up as a cheeky way to tease my teammates every time they asked for coffee.
Features

    Simulates coffee machine operations like selecting coffee types, refilling ingredients, and turning off the machine.
    Built using Python classes and methods, focusing on clean, reusable code.
    Includes playful prompts and messages designed to entertain (or annoy) coffee lovers.

Purpose

    Practice Python programming in a fun, real-world-inspired scenario.
    Explore object-oriented concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
    Bring a bit of humor into the office whenever someone requests coffee.
